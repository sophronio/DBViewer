# DB Viewer

## Description

A way to let your users make their own changes to tables in a database.

# To-Do List

- [] Clear out search query on table name change
- [] Add handling for when search is empty
- [] Connect to Terry and then do some testing with data from an actual database
- [] Add a toggle for dark mode
- [] Add a little information button somewhere that tells the user how to use this and what they can do
- [] Go on the additional features and start implementing them for UX sake
- [] Do some editing to start making it look pretty, so far we're saying Excel based, so let's make it look like that

# User Stories:

<!-- As a basic user, I want to be able to login and logout so that I can access the application whenever I want
    - Login / Logout Front-End Components
    - User Information DB Component
    - Don't need a signup page because the user won't be signing up
As a basic user, I want to be able to see the tables that I am assigned to be able to see which tables that I have access to
As a basic user, I want to be able to click on the tables to see what information is stored inside
As a basic user, I want to be able to edit information in the tables to make sure the tables have all of the correct information
As a basic user, I want to be able to save the changes that I made to have my changes become permanent
As a basic user, I want to be able to see the history of my changes to see what my last changes were and correct them if necessary (optional)
As a basic user, I want to be able to manage my login information to guarantee my usability of the application
As an admin, I want to be able to add users so that the users can go in and edit the information

# Questions:

- Where should security for server <-> database connection be implemented?
  - It's going to have to be the application level from what I've seen so far
- Should a user have an individual connection or is the server the "user" in this case?
  - The server will connect with its own user, the security of who can ask what will need to be implemented using some kind of roles table in the db
- What does this look like in production? How do we control individual user permissions within the server super user?
  - Good question, I think we'll need a roles / users / administration table of some sort with records and stuff
- Will the user need to access multiple databases?

# Additional Features:

- [] Pop-up on Save to make sure the user is about to save
- [] Pop-up on Cancel to make sure user knows their changes are about to disappear
- [] Pop-up on leave page to let user know changes will be cancelled
- [] Need to do something about the primaryKey if it's something where IDENTITY_INSERT is off
  - Gray it out and retrieve that info if it's an autogenerated
- [] Need to add some kind of type checking when editing / adding records

# User Stories MVP:

1. As a basic user, I want to be able to see the list of tables that I have access to
2. As a basic user, I want to be able to edit the rows, columns, and values of that table
3. As a basic user, I want to be able to save my changes
4. As a basic user, I want to be able to search through the rows using a searchbar to get to the correct row quickly

# Back-End Tasks

General Tasks: - DB Connection - SQL Query Executor -

1. As a basic user, I want to be able to see the list of tables that I have access to

   - [x] Create route to get table names
   - [] Modify functionality based upon which tables this user has access to

2. As a basic user, I want to be able to edit the rows, columns, and values of that table -[x] Create route to get table information - Need to make something that gets only a certain amount of information at a time, we know that some of these tables could have a crazy amount of records / rows - I'm thinking the front-end will decide which table is going to be needed so that will be included in the request
   - Create something that either stores the changes or list of changes that can then be run in a batch?
   - I need to get something that allows me to get tables the user has access to.
3. As a basic user, I want to be able to save my changes
   - Create a route that upon save sends all of the updates to the database.
   -

NOTES:

- So if we use pooling, then we can automatically send the updates to the database everytime something is changed and doesn't need to be in a batch
-

# Front-End Tasks

1. As a basic user, I want to be able to see the list of tables that I have access to
   - Create a sidebar that has the list of tables that the user can access
     - This is where we will get the list of table names and stuff and use that route created in the backend
2. As a basic user, I want to be able to edit the rows, columns, and values of that table
   - [] When the user clicks on the tablename, send a request to the backend to get the specific table using the defined route
   - Need to have a way to display all of the table data and initialize that view
   - Need to have a pay to do like a page style view to make sure the user is only looking at x amount of rows at a time
   - Perhaps include something that lets the user select how many records they'd like to view that doesn't burden the front-end/back-end too much
   - Either the table that is shown is already editable or a button that can allow editing
   - Need to create a callback that updates the values when the values is changed on screen
   - If the user stops editing in the middle of it, need to keep the old values in the front-end mem so they can be restored
   - Columns + rows need to be emphasized in terms of styling
3. As a basic user, I want to be able to save my changes
   - I want to be able to see a button that shows my changes have been saved, could also be a feature that shows the save time
   - Perhaps a successful save banner / message/ etc...
   - Maybe execute a callback which sends the updates back to the DB
   - I will want something to stop the user in case they decide to refresh / leave the page stopping them from doing it unless saved
   - Should we keep their changes or leave them if they refresh?
